			<h3>Brief Backstory</h3>
			<p>I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and raised third of four sons in a loving family. I am the tinkerer/mad scientist of my family. I really enjoy trying to come up with solutions to everyday problems and doing things that can teach me something new. In short, my parents' usual question to me is <br><br>"What are you working on now?"
			<br><br>
			I have many hobbies. Most of them originate from learning new techniques for building one of my projects. Some of my most frequented hobbies are:

	 			I enlisted in the military after graduating from high school and proudly served in the U.S. Army as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd Airborne Division for four and a half years. Joining the military was my childhood dream come true and I expected to be a “lifer”, but I was injured while deployed in Afghanistan. I was shot in the arm during an enemy ambush in 2012 and would eventually be medically retired in 2014. I learned a lot about myself throughout these experiences and it has made me a more driven man.

 				<h3>Back to School</h3>

 				<p>
	 			I began my college education at Fayetteville Technical Community College in Fayetteville, NC in 2015. I did not know what major I would want to pursue so I chose general education.  I took classes from all disciplines and found that I was really interested in history and physical sciences. After attaining my associates in general education, my wife and I decided to move our family back home to New Mexico. <br><br>
				I started classes at the University of New Mexico in 2017. I decided to go with a Geography major because I enjoy being outdoors and doing research. I fell in love with the discipline when I found out that I could fly drones, better understand natural systems, make beautiful maps, learn programming, all while visiting historic and iconic sites. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at UNM and plan on returning to pursue my master’s degree in Geography in the near future. <br><br>
				I am currently pursuing a position as a GIS analyst and programmer. I wish to gain real world experience to determine what additional courses I will need to make myself a better geographer. <br><br>Thank you for your interest in my story thus far.
